# Creating Virtual Networking Infrastructure and Deploying Virtual Machines


## Introduction
The lab consists of several tasks that will guide you through the process of creating a virtual network, setting up subnets, creating application security groups, configuring network security groups, and creating inbound security rules. These steps are essential for building a secure and well-structured virtual networking environment.

## Objective
By completing this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in creating and managing virtual networks in Azure, as well as understanding how to control network traffic using security groups and rules. This knowledge will be valuable for designing and implementing networking solutions in Azure, ensuring the security and efficiency of your virtual infrastructure.

Now, let's dive into the lab and start building your virtual networking infrastructure in Azure!

## Task to Implement Virtual Networking Infrastructure

Lab Cleanup:
To avoid incurring unexpected costs, it is essential to remove any unused Azure resources.

Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.<br />
If prompted, select PowerShell and Create storage.<br />
In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to remove the resource group you created in this lab:<br />

```powershell
 Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB07" -Force -AsJob
```
  
Close the Cloud Shell pane.
